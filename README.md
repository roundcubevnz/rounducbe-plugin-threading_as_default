Rounducube plugin: threading_as_default 
========================================

Make the threated view default for all folders to unify the view of the mails in a corporate environment.

forked from xim/threading_as_default for historical and older purposes if original repo will dissapear.

Newer version since 1.1 already has this implemented but not as default. With this threated are default!
This plugin are only for RC << 1.1 and makes the threading view a default for all folders.
This is a hack to work around http://trac.roundcube.net/ticket/1487312 in roundcube.
